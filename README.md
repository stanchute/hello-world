Hello World!

  My name is Stan and I hail from NW Wi. Grantsburg, a small town near the Mn. border.
We count about 1500 souls here. I am an ex-lumberjack who is teaching himself a few things about computers.
About two years ago I couldn't even turn one on or type. 
Now I can repair them and do some beginner coding and scripting.
Not to bad for a 56-year old critter.
